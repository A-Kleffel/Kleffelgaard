                <p>This project is run as similar to a SCRUM project as I could manage solo (sprint-meetings with feedback from myself are always fun!). The project planning and notes are done in Google Sheets and Docs. </p>
                <p>I decided to learn and use JIRA for task management and FIGMA for the design process, as I have heard good things about them at work. Perfect for private project purposes as they are well made, free and easy to use.</p>
                <p>For the design of my website I have chosen colors that speak to me. I personally prefer calm, earthly and minimalistic, so the effects will not be too many at a time.</p>
                <p>For publishing the website I decided to try out Github Pages linked with my own domain.</p>

                    <p>For this project I am setting up a dynamic website with JS, HTML and CSS using Visual Studio Code and Github repositories. For the development I decided to not include React in the first edition, and rather make a separate code for that in a second edition with the new code structure that comes with React.</p>

                <p>During my working life since 1996 I have been in IT for 14 years, security for 7 years and had different customer service jobs. My time in IT started with a few years in IT support, then over to technical projects and project manager before service leader. The last 5 years I have worked as a consultant developer and scrum master in various smaller projects. </p>

                    <h2>Anette the developer</h2>
                    <p>As a developer I prefer frontend where I can be part of the design process, to make beautiful and functional websites or apps that I can be proud of. I aim to be systematic and tidy in my code, and appreciate working with a team for support, feedback and constructive criticism. I am currently a certified website developer in JS, HTML and CSS and previously certified as an android app developer with Java. </p>

                    <h2>Anette the designer</h2>
                    <p>I love design and know how important it is for any development project to have a designer right from the start to avoid having to change too much later on. My interest in design has followed me all my life, loving to draw and paint from a young age and appreciating how combinations of colors and patterns can affect how we feel and what catches the eye.Thinking as a designer I can improve likability, user interest and interaction, and do proper research with design thinking and sketches before starting on the code.</p>

                    <h2>Anette the project and team leader</h2>
                    <p>In the role of team leader or project manager I aim towards making the job as smooth and fun as possible for my team, and to help them be the best versions of themself. I am hands-on and invested in optimizing how the team works and tasks flow. In my experience teams work more efficiently when they have a leader who is involved, whom they can trust and talk to, who is not afraid of taking charge but also open to others opinions. My passion for planning, structure, processes and efficiency shines in these roles. </p>

                    <h2>Anette the co-worker</h2>
                    <p>As an employee I am faithful and respectful towards my company. I enjoy learning new things at a sensible tempo and sharing my experience and knowledge with others. As a person I am practical and easy to talk to. I am fairly social, have a good balance of introvert/extrovert and I bring smiles and humor to the workplace. I have hit a wall at a point in my life and have come out of it with stronger confidence and self-awareness and with great tools to handle stress. The reason I write this here is because I look at this as an asset instead of being ashamed of it. I feel better equipped to handle anything that comes at me compared to someone who has not had this experience.</p>

            <article id="growing-up">
                <h2>growing up</h2>
                <p>Born in Drammen as a lone child, where I lived my first years together with my parents and our pet cat Baltus, Jacko the parrot and fishes (great combo!). </p>
                <p>Already at a young age I showed that I had impeccable style and was not afraid to show it..</p>
                <p>At around the age of 6 we moved to a small village called “Sande”, where my parents built our house from the bottom! It was here I first got interested in gaming and computers as my dad had the interest and that rubbed off on me (same with motorcycles/cars and fixing things myself!). </p>
                <p>We still had a cat and fishes, but for my 6th birthday I got a dog, Topsy. From this day on dogs were always a part of our family as my mom found her passion in life that she still has to this day. Animals have always been an important part of my life, and will probably always be. </p>
                <p>This house I lived in until I left for farming school at the age of 15. The story behind that choice was me having a dream of becoming a veterinarian (didn't even get close), and the need to leave the nest and get out into the world. </p> 
                <p>My serious interest in computers started when I chose “bachelor in computer science” as my way forward after graduating high school some years after. Good choice for a base education when I had zero clue of what I wanted to do with myself. I felt the world was wide open to choose whatever, and had to pick just one (I still feel for the young adults having to make that choice).</p>

            <article id="hobbies">
                <h2>hobbies</h2>
                <p>Over the years I have had many different hobbies as I like to try out new stuff, but the 2 that I still have and have used most time on are horses and gaming. </p>
                <p>My passion for horses as a hobby started at an age of approximately 9 when I had an uncle who was a trainer of racehorses. I spent many hours and days with him on his different projects, helping out and getting my bravery tested (big, energetic horses for a small girl!). Over the years I have never owned my own, but I have had the pleasure of playing with and helping out many lovely and different horses for other owners. One day tho.. One day..</p>
                <p>When it comes to games there are so many types that I enjoy - for different reasons and occasions. My favorite the last few years have been escape rooms where I get to use logic, problem solving and cooperation while pressed on time.</p>
                <p>Logical puzzles like kakuro and sudoku where you have to follow patterns and algorithms I enjoy for relaxing. For chill fun with family and friends I love most board games, cards and family-games. </p>
                <p>When out grabbing a drink with friends or colleagues, as an addition to conversation I prefer an activity like pool or darts (fun fact: I have played Norwegian cups and championships in both in my younger days :P). I DO have a competitive side, but I am not a bad loser, I promise!</p>
                <p>I have games that test my skills in stress-handling, cooperation and optimization through utter chaos like “Overcooked” - hilarious game, try it!</p>
                <p>My skills in planning, management and balancing budgets get tested in city-building simulators like Cities:Skylines where you plan out a city, manage economy and growth, build up infrastructure and make sure your city's inhabitants and businesses are happy.</p>

            <article id="family">
                <h2>family and friends</h2>
                <p>My closest family and friends are very important to me. I do have a big family on both sides, and I have gotten many good friends through the years, but I will keep this brief so I will focus on those that are in my life at the time being and have a big impact on my life today.</p>
                <p>Starting with my mom who is a smart, kind, hard working and practical woman and definitely the parent I have my creative side from. Our home has always been filled with animals, games, music and humor, these are a big part of me and I wouldn't be without them.</p>
                <p>It has not always been easy being a family, but no families are without turbulence. I can talk about anything with my mom, and I love the relationship we have. Hope you live forever, mummy, love you!</p>
                <p>My closest friends are also my chosen family. They are there for me when I need them, telling me what I need to hear (not always what I WANT to hear) - and I love them for it. </p>
                <p>All of us have different backgrounds and personalities, but we have common grounds that link us together as a group. I hope you are in my life for a long time, girls! </p>
